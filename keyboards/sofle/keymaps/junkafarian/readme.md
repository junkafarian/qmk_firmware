# Default keymap for Sofle Keyboard

Layout in [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/76efb423a46cbbea75465cb468eef7ff) and [adjust layer](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/4bcf66f922cfd54da20ba04905d56bd4)


Features:

- Symmetric modifiers (CMD/Super, Alt/Opt, Ctrl, Shift)
- Various modes, can be switched (using Adjust layer and the selected one is stored in EEPROM.
- Modes for Qwerty and Colemak support
- Modes for Mac vs Linux/Win support -> different order of modifiers and different action shortcuts on the "UPPER" layer (the red one in the image). Designed to simplify transtions when switching between operating systems often.
- The OLED on master half shows selected mode and caps lock state and is rotated.
- Left encoder controls volume up/down/mute. Right encoder PGUP/PGDOWN.


## Updating

1. Make changes to `keymap.c` and save
2. Run `qmk compile`
3. Detach minijack cable
4. Run `qmk flash`
5. Connect usb-c cable to other half and run `qmk flash` again

## Flashing issues

The homebrew installed version of avrdude resulted in the following error when flashing:

```
% qmk flash

reinstalling didn't seem to make a difference, but installing avrdude from source [following these instructions](https://github.com/avrdudes/avrdude/wiki/Building-AVRDUDE-for-macOS) seemed to work. N.B. I needed to uninstall avrdude without uninstalling qmk through homebrew so ran `brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies avrdude`
